# TypeScript Syntax Archive

This repository is a personal archive created to **review and refresh core TypeScript concepts**.

It focuses on TypeScript’s **syntax, type system, and language features**, organized in a simple and easy-to-reference structure.

---

## Structure

### `src/section1` ~ `section9`

Each section covers a specific TypeScript concept with **clear syntax examples**, such as:

- Type inference
- Type narrowing
- Union & intersection types
  ...

These sections are meant as a **quick reminder and reference**, not a full tutorial.

---

### `exproject/`

A small **React + TypeScript** example project.

- Simple Todo List application
- Uses only basic React features
- Focuses on applying TypeScript in a real component-based setup
- No heavy libraries or complex architecture

---

## Purpose

- To archive and revisit TypeScript language concepts
- To reinforce understanding through small, focused examples
- To connect TypeScript syntax with a practical React use case
